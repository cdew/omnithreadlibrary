1.0: 2008-08-26
- Initial release.

1.0a: 2008-09-02
- TGp4AlignedInt from GpStuff.pas is supposedly D2006 compatible (says a reader) 
  so it has been enabled on that plaform. As a result, it is now possible to 
  compiled and use OTL in D2006 (said the same source).
- SpinLock.pas has been updated.
- Test 6 has been changed to show why one would want to use 
  IOmniWorker.Implementor function.
- FastMM 4.88 included in the repository to simplify debugging.
  FastMM4 was created by Pierre le Riche and is not covered by the 
  OmniThreadLibrary license. It is released under a dual licensed and you can use 
  it either under the MPL 1.1 or LGPL 2.1. More details in the included readme 
  file and on the FastMM4 home page.

1.01: 2008-11-01
- [GJ] Redesigned stack cotainer with better lock contention.
- [GJ] Totally redesigned queue container, which is no longer based on stack and 
  allows multiple reader.
- Full D2009 support; D2009 packages, project files and Tests project group.
- Invoke-by-name and invoke-by-address messaging implemented
  (http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2008/10/erlangenizing-omnithreadlibrary.html and
  http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/2008/10/omnithreadlibrary-using-rtti-to-call.html
  and demos 18 and 19).
- CreateTask(reference to function (task: ITaskControl)) implemented (D2009 only).
- Blocking wait (ReceiveWait) implemented (demo 19).
- Added enumerator to the IOmniTaskGroup interface.
- Implemented IOmniTaskGroup.RegisterAllWithTask and .UnregisterAllFromTask.
- Added automatic comm unregistration for IOmniTaskGroup.RegisterAllCommWith.
- Implemented IOmniTaskGroup.SendToAll. 
- New/updated tests/demos:
  - 10_Containers 
    - 2 -> 2, 1 -> 4 and 4 -> 4 tests for stacks and queues, 
    - [1, 2, 4] -> [1, 2, 4] full tests.
    - Writes CSV file with cumulative test results.
  - 17_MsgWait: demo for the .MsgWait decorator.
  - 18_StringMsgDispatch: Invoke demo.
  - 19_StringMsgBenchmark: Invoke benchmark, ReceiveWait demo.
  - 20_QuickSort: Parallel quicksort demo.
  - 21_Anonymous_methods: Anonymous methods demo (D2009 only).
- Message ID $FFFF is now reserved for internal purposes.
- Better default queue length calculation that takes into account OtlContainers 
  overhead and FastMM4 granulation.
- Bug fixed: TOmniValue.Null was not really initialized to Null.
- Bug fixed: Setting timer interval resets timer countdown.
- Bug fixed: TOmniTaskControl.Schedule always scheduled task to the global 
  thread pool.
- Current versions of 3rd party units included.

1.02: 2009-02-01
- Thread pool reimplemented using OmniThreadLibrary.
- Implemented IOmniTaskControl/IOmniTask.Enforced decorator.
- Implemented IOmniTaskControlList, a list of IOmniTaskControl interfaces.
- Added background file search demo.
- Implemented TOmniCS critical section wrapper.
- Fixed a bug in TGpStringTable.Grow and TGpStringDictionary.Grow which 
  caused random memory overwrites.
- Bug fixed: One overload of SetParameter was not returning Self.
- [Jamie] Fixed bug in TOmniTaskExecutor.Asy_SetTimerInt.
- [ajasja] Fixed bug in demos 4, 5, and 6. Exceptions was raised if demo app
  was closed without stopping the background task first.
- Updated to FastMM 4.90.
- Current versions of 3rd party units included.

1.03: 2009-02-08
- Added support for per-thread initialized data to the thread pool.
- Communication between TOmniThreadPool and TOTPWorker is protected with a critical 
  section. That allows multiple threads to Schedule tasks into one thread pool.
- Removed OnWorkerThreadCreated_Asy/OnWorkerThreadDestroyed_Asy thread pool 
  notification mechanism which was pretty much useless.
- Added connection pool demo.
